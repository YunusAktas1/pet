This directory contains the Alembic migration environment for the backend
service.

Key files:

* ``env.py`` – configures Alembic to work with SQLModel metadata and reads the
  ``DATABASE_URL`` environment variable.
* ``script.py.mako`` – template used when generating new migration revisions.
* ``versions/`` – stores individual migration scripts.

Typical commands::

    alembic revision --autogenerate -m "describe change"
    alembic upgrade head
    alembic downgrade -1
